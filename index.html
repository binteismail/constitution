Main article:<a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan"> Constitution of Pakistan of 1956</a></p>

<p>Following the adoption of a <a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India">constitution</a> in India in 1950, Pakistan's lawmakers were incentified to work on their<br>
 constitution. Prime Minister <a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaudhry_Muhammad_Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> and his government officials worked with the <a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Pakistan">opposition parties</a> in the<br>
 country to formulate a constitution for Pakistan.<a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan#cite_note-Nazaria-e-Pakistan,_part_I-15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

Finally, the joint work led to the promulgation of the first set of the constitution on 23 March 1956—a day when<br>
 Pakistan celebrates its<a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Day"> Republic Day</a> over the adoption of the constitution. The constitution provided for<br>
<a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system"> parliamentary form</a> of government with a <a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism">unicameral legislature.<sup>[15]</sup></a> It officially adopted Pakistan as <a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_republic">"Islamic<br>
 Republic"</a> and the principle of parity was introduced. Its features were:
<br><br>

 opposed to Constitution, dismissed four elected <a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan">prime ministers</a> in two years. Under public pressure, Mirza<br>
 upheld the <a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Pakistani_military_coup">coup d'état</a> in 1958, thus virtually suspending the constitution. Shortly afterwards <a Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ayub_Khan">General Ayub Khan</a><br>
